<p>For combined beauty and interest&mdash;varied beauty
and historical interest&mdash;there is no place &ldquo;within easy
reach of London&rdquo;, certainly no place within the suburban
radius, that can compare with the stately Tudor
palace which stands on the left bank of the Thames,
little more than a dozen miles from the metropolis
and, though hidden in trees, within eye-reach of Richmond.
It is not only one of the &ldquo;show places&rdquo;,
which every traveller from afar is supposed to visit
as something of a duty, but it is a place that conveys
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg&nbsp;6]</a></span>
impressions of beauty and restfulness in a way that
few others can. It remains ancient without having
lapsed into a state of desuetude that leaves everything
to the imagination; it is a living whole far from
any of the garishness that belongs to contemporaneity.
Whether seen from the outside on the west, where the
warm red brick, the varied roofs, the clustered decorative
chimneys suggestive of the Tudor time make a
rich and harmonious whole; or from the south east,
where the many-windowed long straight lines of the
Orange additions show the red brick diversified with
white stone, it is a noble and impressive pile. Within,
too, are priceless treasures, themselves alone the objective
of countless pilgrimages. And recognizing the
attractions of the buildings and their contents is to
take no account of the lovely grounds, and of the
crowding associations of a place that, since its establishment
four hundred years ago, has again and again
been the centre at which history was made.</p>

<p>Throughout our records for many centuries the
valley of the Thames has been favoured when our
monarchs have sought to establish a new home. Greenwich
and London&mdash;the Tower, Whitehall, Buckingham
Palace&mdash;Richmond and Hampton Court, Windsor,
Reading and Oxford, are some of the places that
have at one time or another been the chosen centre
of royal life; and Hampton Court Palace is the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg&nbsp;7]</a></span>
newest of those situated close on the river&rsquo;s bank,
though nearly two hundred years have elapsed since
it was a regular royal residence. It was, indeed, for
something less than the same length of time that it
was in use as a home of the sovereign, but within
that period it saw two revolutions, and the change
of national conditions from the comparative medi&aelig;valism
of the days of the eighth Henry to the comparative
modernity of the beginning of the Hanoverian
era. It is not, perhaps, overfanciful to see something
of the lavish richness, the opulent homeliness, of the
earlier period typified in the varied buildings, courts,
and gateways of the Tudor portion of the Palace, and
the more formal grandeur of the later time in the symmetrical
stateliness of the later part.</p>

<p>Hampton Court Palace was the centre of many of
the bluff King Henry&rsquo;s hunting parties&mdash;and the scene
of some of his marital excitements, and here, too, his
long-hoped-for son was born; it was the scene of Elizabethan
pageantry, and of the attempt on the part of
the Virgin Queen&rsquo;s successor to force other men&rsquo;s religion
into his own particular groove; at Hampton
Court Charles the First was seen at his best in the
domestic circle and&mdash;after the interregnum&mdash;where
his son was seen at his worst in anti-domestic
intrigues. Here Cromwell sought rest from cares
greater than those of a king, and here he was stricken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg&nbsp;8]</a></span>
with mortal illness; here William and Mary dwelt,
and here the former met with the seemingly trivial
accident which cost him his life. That the &ldquo;story&rdquo;
of Hampton Court is, indeed, a full, splendid, and varied
one is shown in the three fine volumes in which it is
set forth by Mr. Ernest Law, a work to which no
writer on the history of the Palace can help feeling
indebted. Those who would learn the intimacies and
details of the history of the place have Mr. Law&rsquo;s
history, and those who seek a &ldquo;guide&rdquo; are well provided
for in the official publications. Here, I am concerned
with the history of the place only in its broader
and more salient points, and with the minor details
necessary in a guidebook not at all; I seek rather to
give something of an impression of the past and
present of the Palace, something that shall at once
indicate the associations of the place, indicate its
story, and hint at what there is to see, and that shall
serve as souvenir and remembrancer of that which
has been seen.</p>

<h2>II</h2>


<p>It was just before he became a cardinal that
Thomas Wolsey, on 11 January, 1515, took a ninety-nine
years&rsquo; lease of the manor of Hampton Court from
the Knights Hospitaller of St. John of Jerusalem, and
at once set about building the magnificent pile which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg&nbsp;9]</a></span>
remains his most enduring monument. There appears
to have been here an earlier manor house or mansion,
for there is a record of Henry the Seventh visiting it
a few years before the lease was granted; but probably
Wolsey did away entirely with the older building
and planned the whole place anew. Rapidly rising
in royal favour the Cardinal designed a lordly pleasure
house on the banks of the Thames, where he could
worthily entertain his pleasure-loving sovereign, and
where he could hold state in a manner that should
prove impressive in the eyes of ambassadors and other
important visitors from foreign Courts.</p>

<p>It is said that Wolsey&rsquo;s health was such that it
was necessary for him to have a residence away from
London, yet his position made it essential that he
should still be within easy reach of the capital; therefore
he &ldquo;employed the most eminent physicians in
England and even called in the aid of doctors from
Padua, to select the most healthy spot within twenty
miles of London&rdquo;, and the result was the selection
of Hampton and the erection of the princely Palace
which has seen its royal neighbours of Hanworth and
Richmond pass from palaces to mere fragments, and
Nonsuch disappear entirely.</p>

<p>Having acquired his new manor Wolsey lost no
time in getting his designs carried into execution, and
the magnificent edifice, built about five courts or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg&nbsp;10]</a></span>
quadrangles, grew so rapidly that in 1516 he was already
able to entertain Henry the Eighth here. The whole
Palace was of red brick, and surmounted by many
castellated turrets topped by ornamental lead cupolas.
The western portion of the buildings probably gives
us a very fair idea of the whole as it was planned,
though all the turrets from this aspect are wanting
their cupolas, though the gatehouse is less lofty than
it was originally and though some more westerly buildings
have disappeared.</p>

<p>As the Cardinal waxed in importance his stately
palace grew until its magnificence set tongues wagging,
and it was said that the Churchman&rsquo;s residence
outshone in splendour the castles of the King. John
Skelton, in his satire <i>Why come ye not to Court?</i>
probably only gave fuller expression to things which
many people were saying, when the powerful favourite
was approaching the period of his declination:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Why come ye not to court?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To whyche Court?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Kynge&rsquo;s courte,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or to Hampton Court?&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, to the Kynge&rsquo;s court:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Kynge&rsquo;s Courte<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shulde have the excellence;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Hampton Court<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath the preemynence.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Yorke&rsquo;s Place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With my lord&rsquo;s grace,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg&nbsp;11]</a></span>
<span class="i0">To whose magnifycence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is all the conflewence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sutys and supplycacons<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Embassades of all nacyons.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>York Place was Cardinal Wolsey&rsquo;s scarcely less magnificent
residence at Westminster.</p>

<p>Whether inspired by jealousy owing to the things
said of the state upheld by Wolsey, or whether his
repeated visits simply inspired the monarch with envy
of his Chancellor&rsquo;s new palace cannot be said, but
when Hampton Court had been building for ten years
King Henry, we are told, asked the Chancellor why
he had erected so magnificent a place. &ldquo;To show
how noble a palace a subject may offer to his Sovereign,&rdquo;
was the reply of the Cardinal&mdash;a truly courtly
and an unquestionably costly compliment. The King
accepted the noble gift, but Wolsey continued from
time to time to occupy his own whilom palace at
Hampton and was besides given permission to make
use of the royal palace at Richmond. This was in
1525, and already it may be the shadow of coming
events was over both the powerful Churchman and
the fickle King, though Wolsey was still three or
four years from that final downfall which was soon
followed by his death.</p>

<p>Though the ownership of Hampton Court had
passed from the subject to the sovereign, the former
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg&nbsp;12]</a></span>
continued on occasion to do the honours of the place
to distinguished visitors. In 1527, for example, there
came a noble &ldquo;ambasset&rdquo; from France, and arrangements
were made for the due entertainment here of
the French nobles and their retinue. A full account
of it is given in George Cavendish&rsquo;s <i>Life and Death
of Thomas Wolsey</i>, the earliest of our biographies
and assuredly one of the most delightful. There is
not space here to transcribe Cavendish&rsquo;s full account
of the splendid entertainment accorded to &ldquo;this great
ambasset ... who were in number above fourscore
and the most noblest and worthiest gentlemen in all
the court of France&rdquo;; but the biographer, who was
gentleman-usher to the Cardinal, and thus well situated
for giving an authoritative record of things, was
also an admirable narrator, and from his description
we may get a good idea of Tudor prodigality and
splendour. Not only were there the fourscore French
nobles, but there were also their trains and the many
home visitors who must have been invited to accompany
them; so that two hundred and eighty beds had
to be arranged. We are told how the best cooks
were brought together, and wrought day and night
in the preparing of &ldquo;divers subtleties and many
crafty devices&rdquo;, how the purveyors &ldquo;brought and sent
in such plenty of costly provisions as ye would
wonder at the same&rdquo;, and further:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg&nbsp;13]</a></span>
&ldquo;The yeomen and grooms of the wardrobes were busied in
hanging of the chambers with costly hangings, and furnishing
the same with beds of silk, and other furniture apt for the same
in every degree. Then my Lord Cardinal sent me, being gentleman
usher, with two other of my fellows, to Hampton Court to
foresee all things touching our rooms, to be noblily garnished
accordingly. Our pains were not small or light, but travailing
daily from chamber to chamber. Then the carpenters, the joiners,
the masons, the painters, and all other artificers necessary to glorify
the house and feast were set to work. There was carriage and
re-carriage of plate, stuff and other rich implements; so that there
was nothing lacking or to be imagined or devised for the purpose.
There were also fourteen score beds provided and furnished
with all manner of furniture to them belonging, too long particularly
here to rehearse. But to all wise men it sufficeth to imagine,
that knoweth what belongeth to the furniture of such triumphant
feast or banquet.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Cavendish goes on to tell of the sumptuousness
and wonder of the entertainment which the Cardinal
gave to his guests before speeding them on their
way to Windsor on the following day. Of the furnishing
of the chambers for the &ldquo;fourteen score beds&rdquo;
prepared for the guests, he gives details which suggest
an extraordinary display of gold and silver; but the
whole account should be read in the biography of
Wolsey, where it gives us a peculiarly full and detailed
description of the splendour of banqueting in
Tudor days. And it must be added, that though &ldquo;the
Frenchmen, as it seemed, were rapt into paradise&rdquo;,
yet this feast at Hampton Court was but as &ldquo;silver
is compared to gold&rdquo; when contrasted with that which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg&nbsp;14]</a></span>
the King gave at Greenwich a little later to speed
his parting guests on their homeward journey. In
the full account which Cavendish gives of the feasting
at Hampton Court and in his description of the
furnishings of York House, Westminster, when Wolsey
left it on his last unhappy journey, we have glimpses
of the richness and magnificence to which the great
men of the sixteenth century had attained in the
heyday of Henry the Eighth. King Henry was at
Hampton Court, engaged in practising archery in the
park when George Cavendish arrived with the news
of Wolsey&rsquo;s death, and the bluff King paid his old
and too loyal servant the tribute of saying that he
would rather have given &pound;20,000 than he had died.
The King did not, however, let any sentiment about
the builder of Hampton Court trouble him long or
interfere with his plans.</p>

<p class="caption">A CORNER OF WOLSEY&rsquo;S KITCHEN</p>

<p>When the monarch came into full possession
of Hampton Court he soon converted the lease
into freehold by arrangements with the Knights
Hospitaller, and at once set about having it made
yet more magnificent than before. Among his improvements
was the erection of the Great Hall&mdash;one
of the finest buildings of the kind belonging to
the Tudor period that remain to us; he rebuilt, or at
any rate considerably altered, the Chapel, and made
many other changes in the Palace. His additions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg&nbsp;15]</a></span>
and alterations may sometimes be recognized by the
working of his monogram and those of his wives into
the decoration, as in the roof of Anne Boleyn&rsquo;s Gateway,
where that unhappy lady&rsquo;s initial is to be seen.
For though this roof is a modern restoration, it is
a restoration believed to be in accordance with the
original design. Such evidence is not therefore always
conclusive, for sometimes the monograms are not contemporary
records&mdash;as in the windows of the Great
Hall where the stained glass, full of such personal
allusions, is all modern, having been put in between
sixty and seventy years ago. Those responsible for
the replacing, after a long interval, of the glass that
had been destroyed when all concerning royalty was
out of favour, worked in monograms and devices in
a way that misleads many visitors, some of whom
seeing &ldquo;H&rdquo; and &ldquo;J&rdquo; in the glass, too rashly assume
that it dates from the time when Jane Seymour was
the much married monarch&rsquo;s queen.</p>

<p>When Anne Boleyn&rsquo;s ambition was gratified and
she was made Henry&rsquo;s second queen&mdash;vice Katherine
of Arragon, divorced&mdash;Hampton Court became for a
time a scene of royal revelling. It was not so for
long, however, for already the King&rsquo;s passion was
cooling. It was at Hampton Court that King Henry&rsquo;s
hopes of a son and heir were disappointed for the
third time, when, early in 1536, Anne there gave birth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg&nbsp;16]</a></span>
to a still-born child. In the following May the unhappy
Queen&rsquo;s brief triumph was brought to a tragic
close by the sword of the executioner on Tower Hill,
and on the very next day King Henry was formally
betrothed to Jane Seymour. In October of the following
year Queen Jane gave birth in this Palace,
presumably in that part of the buildings demolished
more than a century and a half later, to a son who
afterwards became King Edward the Sixth. The
arrival of a male heir was no doubt a matter of great
gratification to King Henry, and served to lessen any
sorrow that his easily salved affections might otherwise
have felt from the fact that the Queen only survived
the child&rsquo;s birth but a brief while. When he was
but three days old the infant prince was christened
here in great state. The Princess Mary held her
tiny brother, twenty years her junior, during the
ceremony at the solid silver font, while the child
Princess Elizabeth, herself carried, bore the chrysm.
Nine days after the christening of her son Queen
Jane died.</p>

<p>The birth of Prince Edward in the Palace seems
to have increased King Henry&rsquo;s liking for his Thames-side
pleasaunce, and in 1540 he caused the Honour of
Hampton Court to be created by Act of Parliament&mdash;the
Honour including a number of manors on both
sides of the Thames. But the King further showed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg&nbsp;17]</a></span>
his liking for the place&mdash;and his scant regard for his
subjects&mdash;by making it the centre of a Chase, having
a large extent of the land on either side of the river
afforested and enclosed with palings so that, though
growing corpulent and unwieldy, he might yet be able
to indulge in his favourite pastime of hunting.</p>

<p>At the end of July, 1540, King Henry quietly married
Katherine Howard, and in August she was openly
shown at Hampton Court as his fifth queen. Little
more than a year later and the Palace saw the beginning
of the slow drama which ended with her execution
on Tower Hill in February, 1543; for it was while
Henry was at Mass in the chapel here that Cranmer
put into his hands the beginning of the evidence
which was to prove a fatal net for the entangling of
Queen Katherine. The story runs that the Queen
sought to have a personal explanation with King
Henry, but he would not see her after once the charges
were made, and when she tried to get to him in the
chapel she was borne shrieking away by the attendants
along what is now known as the Haunted
Gallery. There her wraith has since been seen and
heard!</p>

<p>The bluff King seems to have been little troubled
by his various pasts, nor to have been worried at all
by earlier associations, for in the summer of 1543 he
was married here at Hampton Court, to the last of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg&nbsp;18]</a></span>
his queens, Katherine Parr, in the presence of the
daughters of Katherine of Arragon and Anne Boleyn,
the Princesses Mary and Elizabeth. Thus the Palace
has associations with all of the six queens of King
Henry, the one of whom Hampton Court has least
memory being Anne of Cleves, the Queen who appears
never to have had even the briefest place in the roving
affections of the King, and who enjoyed little of
the Court splendour beyond the magnificence of her
reception at Greenwich. Anne was at Hampton while
awaiting the decree of divorce which followed close
upon the ceremony of her marriage; and it was the
neighbouring Palace of Richmond that became the
home of this Queen, who was promptly removed from
the position of the King&rsquo;s wife to that of his &ldquo;sister&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Edward the Sixth during his short reign appears
to have been but little associated with the place of
his birth, though he was here when the Protector
Somerset was nearing his fall, and hence were sent
out frantic appeals to the people to come armed to
the defence of their youthful sovereign. Here King
Edward splendidly entertained Mary of Guise, Queen-Dowager
of Scotland, on her journey through England.
The most notable association of Hampton Court with
the boy-king&rsquo;s reign is, however, that it was then
that the aggrieved people of the surrounding afforested
area dared to give voice to their feelings and petition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg&nbsp;19]</a></span>
against that oppression before which they had had to
bow under Henry. The petition was successful, and
the district was dechased, the palings and deer being
removed.</p>

<p>King Edward&rsquo;s dour sister-successor Queen Mary
and her sombre spouse Philip of Spain were scarcely
the people to make the place bright on their occasional
visits, and when they were here shortly after their marriage
it was said &ldquo;the hall door within the Court was
continually shut, so that no man might enter unless
his errand were first known: which seemed strange
to Englishmen, that had not been used thereto&rdquo;. The
most gorgeous association of the depressing couple
with Hampton Court was the Christmas feast of 1554,
when the Great Hall was illuminated &ldquo;with a thousand
lamps curiously disposed&rdquo;.</p>

<p>When Elizabeth came to the throne the Palace
became again the centre of much Court splendour.
It is a curious fact that although magnificence and
pomp are generally more associated with Roman
Catholic than with Protestant Courts, the Tudors
were exceptions to the rule. Under Queen Elizabeth,
Hampton Court saw again something of the
brilliancy and pageantry in which her father had
delighted. Here Her Majesty held high revel at
Christmas on more than one occasion&mdash;&ldquo;if ye would
know what we do here,&rdquo; wrote one in attendance to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg&nbsp;20]</a></span>
a friend, in 1592, &ldquo;we play at tables, dance&mdash;and
keep Christmas&rdquo;. Elizabeth had been brought to
Hampton Court shortly after the marriage of her
sister with Philip, in the hope that she might be
turned to their way of religion, but though she was
for a time a sort of semi-prisoner in the Palace it
became one of her favoured places of residence after
her accession. Here she toyed with the idea of matrimony
and entertained wooers or their ambassadors,
and here she held high state and gorgeous pageantry
of which many records have been kept. Elizabeth
appears, indeed, to have had something of her father&rsquo;s
love for the place and to have added to it or embellished
it from time to time. On the south side
of the Palace, Wren&rsquo;s reconstruction stops short at
beautiful bayed windows doubly decorated with the
monogram E.&nbsp;R. and the date 1568.</p>

<p>A foreign Duke visiting Hampton Court during
Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign described it as the most splendid,
most magnificent royal palace of any to be found in
England or any other kingdom, and the details which
he gives seems to bear this out. More especially was
he struck by what a later verse writer described as
&ldquo;that most pompous room called Paradise&rdquo;, a room
which, according to the ducal description, &ldquo;captivates
the eyes of all who enter by the dazzling of pearls of
all kinds&rdquo;, and &ldquo;in particular there is one apartment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg&nbsp;21]</a></span>
belonging to the Queen, in which she is accustomed to
sit in state, costly beyond everything; the tapestries
are garnished with gold, pearls, and precious stones&mdash;one
table-cover alone is valued at above fifty thousand
crowns&mdash;not to mention the royal throne, which is
studded with very large diamonds, rubies, sapphires
and the like that glitter among other precious stones
and pearls as the sun among the stars&rdquo;.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<h2>III</h2>


<p>If under the Tudors&mdash;more especially the pleasure-loving
Henry and the display-loving Elizabeth&mdash;Hampton
Court was the scene of much splendid pageantry,
under the Stuart monarchs it was the scene of more
varied happenings, even as it was the home of yet
more varied rulers. The Stuart regime began, however,
quite in the spirit of the Palace traditions, for
here, during the first Christmas after James had ascended
the English throne, there were grand festivities
including the presentation of some of those masques
then coming into vogue. Indeed, Daniel&rsquo;s <i>Vision of
the Twelve Goddesses</i>, presented in the Great Hall
here by the Queen and her Ladies of Honour on
8 January, 1604, has been described as the first true
masque in the literary sense. Many contemporary
letters throw light on this Christmas celebration, when,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg&nbsp;22]</a></span>
if one letter writer is to be believed, as many as thirty
masques and interludes were presented, when all the
Court, the foreign ambassadors and their attendants
thronged to Hampton Court. The twelve hundred
rooms of the Palace did not suffice, many people had
to put up in the outbuildings, while tents were erected
in the park for a number of the servants&mdash;the fact that
three or four people died daily in these tents from
the plague (then ravaging London) does not appear
to have been allowed to interfere with the festivities.
There was tilting and running at the ring in the park
and other diversions, but the masquings seem to have
formed the most important part of the celebration, and
of these, of course, the chief was that &ldquo;Vision&rdquo; in which
the Queen took part in the Great Hall. King James
sat in state on the dais by the great oriel window,
spectators were presumably ranged in tiers along
either side of the hall, and from a &ldquo;heaven&rdquo; above
the Minstrels&rsquo; Gallery the goddesses descended to
their dancing on the floor of the hall. The &ldquo;scenes&rdquo;
at either end of the hall were designed by no less
notable a craftsman than Inigo Jones.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>That same month of January, 1604, which saw here
such magnificent masquings saw also in Hampton
Court a gathering of a very different kind&mdash;a gathering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg&nbsp;23]</a></span>
which, although it proved abortive so far as its
particular purpose was concerned, yet had one remarkable
consequence. Says Carlyle in his survey of the
beginnings of the seventeenth-century prefatory to the
Cromwell letters:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;In January, 1603-4, was held at Hampton Court a kind of Theological
Convention of intense interest all over England ... now
very dimly known, if at all known, as the &lsquo;Hampton Court Conference&rsquo;.
It was a meeting for the settlement of some dissentient
humours in religion.... Four world-famous Doctors from Oxford
and Cambridge represented the pious straitened class, now beginning
to be generally conspicuous under the nickname <i>Puritans</i>.
The Archbishop, the Bishop of London, also world-famous men, with
a considerable reserve of other bishops, deans, and dignitaries, appeared
for the Church by itself Church.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>The one great consequence of the Conference was
the undertaking of the Authorized Translation of the
Bible; for the rest, the King eloquently &ldquo;scouted to
the wind&rdquo; the Puritans, and threatened that if they
did not conform he would hurry them out of the
country. Thus early in the years of the Stuart rule
may be said to have begun at Hampton Court that
struggle between conformity and nonconformity which
was to have momentous results later on in the same
century.</p>

<p>When Charles the First succeeded his father as
King, Hampton Court continued a favourite royal residence.
This monarch appears to have had something
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg&nbsp;24]</a></span>
of the same dread of the plague as inspired Henry
the Eighth and Elizabeth, and when it broke out in
London he hurriedly removed the Court to this Palace
and issued a proclamation prohibiting all communication
with the capital during the continuance of the
visitation. He and his queen seem to have particularly
favoured this one of their palaces, and not only
made frequent stays here but continually added to the
works of art and furnishings of the rooms.</p>

<p>Hampton Court was also to have its part in those
later chapters of the life of the vacillating king which
led up to the tragic finish at Whitehall. On 10 January,
1642, King Charles journeyed from London to Hampton
and arrived here for the last time as a free king. The
inevitable breaking-point had come, and hence he set
forth to the early scenes of civil war. He was not
at Hampton Court again until the August of 1647, and
then it was virtually as a prisoner &ldquo;in the power of
those execrable villains&rdquo;, who had the courage to
regard the welfare of the people before that of their
titular ruler. Leaving his cloak in the gallery by way
of diverting suspicion, on 11 November, 1647, the King
&ldquo;passed by the backstairs and vault to the waterside&rdquo;
and so made good his escape, and fled in a fashion
that made any reconciliation of the opposing parties
impossible.</p>

<p>In the beginning of 1649 came the culminating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg&nbsp;25]</a></span>
tragedy and two years later the manor of Hampton
Court was sold to one John Phelps. The Palace itself
was presumably not included in the transaction, for
shortly afterwards it was occupied by Oliver Cromwell.</p>

<p>During the troubles between King and Parliament
some damage was done at Hampton Court&mdash;damage
which may well be deplored, but which will always
be done by the least thoughtful in any such conflict.
We may, to-day particularly, regret the destruction
of the stained glass in the windows of the Great Hall,
but in defence of the iconoclasts it must be remembered
that stained glass was associated by them with
those aspects of religion which they were banded together
to overthrow. Destruction is one of the most
persistent of primitive instincts, and should such an
outbreak as that of the sixteenth century occur again&mdash;there
would again be wanton destruction.</p>

<p>Under the Commonwealth Hampton Court of course
saw none of the pageantry to which kings and queens
had accustomed it, but on 18 November, 1657, it was
here that Oliver Cromwell&rsquo;s daughter, Mary, was
married to Lord Falconbridge, and the nuptials were
honoured with &ldquo;Two Songs&rdquo; from the pen of Andrew
Marvell, in one of which the poet used the courtly
conceit applicable to a November marriage of:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;They have chosen such an hour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When she is the only flower.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg&nbsp;26]</a></span>
In August of the following year the Protector&rsquo;s
other daughter, his favourite one, it is said, Mrs.
Elizabeth Claypole, died at Hampton Court, and the
grieved father was taken ill of the malady of which
less than a month later he died at Whitehall. In the
<i>Journal</i> of Fox the Quaker occurs the following
striking passage about a meeting with Cromwell.
&ldquo;I met him riding into Hampton Court Park, and
before I came to him, as he rode at the head of his
life guard, I saw and felt a waft of death go forth
against him, and when I came to him he looked like
a dead man.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="caption">MASTER CARPENTER&rsquo;S COURT</p>

<p>After Oliver Cromwell&rsquo;s death it was proposed
that Hampton Court Palace should be sold, but the
supporters of the Commonwealth under Richard Cromwell
were at loggerheads on the subject, one party
thinking that the place should be reserved &ldquo;for the
retirement of those that were engaged in Public affairs,
when they should be indisposed in the summer season&rdquo;,
the other, &ldquo;that such places might justly be accounted
amongst those things that prove temptations to ambitious
men, and exceedingly tend to sharpen their
appetite to ascend the Throne&rdquo;. To-day we may say
that it is fortunate that the first party won the day,
and the Parliament duly ordered &ldquo;that the House
called Hampton Court, with the outhouses and gardens
thereunto belonging, and the little park where it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg&nbsp;27]</a></span>
stands, be stayed from sale, until the Parliament
takes further order&rdquo;. Still the Parliament men were
evidently determined that the view taken by those
who regarded such places as temptations to power
should not be forgotten, for Richard Cromwell was
formally taken to task for having the temerity to go
to Hampton to hunt the deer! Then, despite the
temptation it might prove, the Long Parliament offered
Hampton Court to General Monck, but that astute
man, thinking it a dangerous gift, would accept no
more than the custody and stewardship of it for life&mdash;and
was thus able to hand it over to Charles the
Second on the accomplishment of that Restoration,
in which he probably already regarded himself as
an important factor.</p>

<p>Under the restored Stuarts the Palace became once
more the scene of brilliant Court doings. Here King
Charles brought his bride, Catherine of Braganza, and
here took place the contest which preceded that
Queen&rsquo;s acceptance of Charles&rsquo;s mistress, Lady Castlemaine,
as one of her attendant ladies. An important
development of the surroundings of the Palace was
made by Charles the Second in slightly shortening
the Long Canal and bordering it with avenues of
limes, thus providing for later generations a lovely
vista from the east front of the buildings.</p>

<p>Samuel Pepys and John Evelyn, the diverse diarists
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg&nbsp;28]</a></span>
to whom we owe so much of our intimate knowledge
of their time, were both frequently here, and both
have left us characteristic passages about it; Evelyn
enlarging upon the art treasures and the gardens,
Pepys noting that &ldquo;it was pretty to see the young,
pretty ladies&rdquo;.</p>

<h2>IV</h2>


<p>It is with the coming of William the Third and
Mary to rule the kingdom, a work for which James
the Second had proved himself unfit, that Hampton
Court came to be formed as we know it now.
King James seems never to have stayed in the Palace
after his accession, but his daughter and her husband
soon made of it a favourite and favoured residence.
It is to William and Mary that the Palace owes its
beautiful galleries and many of the art treasures in
them. Calling to his aid Sir Christopher Wren, King
William resolved to rebuild a large part of the great
Tudor palace, and mould it nearer to his heart&rsquo;s desire.
A considerable part of the place was entirely demolished,
comprising the whole series of buildings around
the Cloister Green Court, and forming the south-eastern
portion in which were the royal rooms that
formed the residential centre of the extensive palace.
Where this large part of the old edifice had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg&nbsp;29]</a></span>
razed Wren erected, in striking contrast to the
Tudor portions left standing north and west of it,
the Renaissance building, which is probably remembered
by many visitors as the chief feature of Hampton
Court. Contrasting strongly with the earlier portions
of the Palace the new fronts and the beautiful Fountain
Court yet do not clash with them, thanks to the
way in which the architect carried out his work.</p>

<p>While the new additions were being made to the
Palace King William and Queen Mary frequently
stayed at Hampton Court, the Water Gallery&mdash;a detached
portion of the Tudor buildings standing on
the riverside at the end of what is now the Broad
Walk&mdash;being furnished and decorated to afford a temporary
residence. Not only were the State Chambers
rebuilt in this reign, but the gardens were newly laid
out and planted&mdash;a work in which the Queen greatly
interested herself. Despite these vast changes yet
more were contemplated, for Sir Christopher Wren
had planned a new approach and entrance on the
north side. Her Majesty did not live to occupy the
State Apartments, and her death in 1694 delayed
for several years the completion of the work. As
for King William, he, too, did not live long to
enjoy his new palace, for having come hither on
21 February, 1702, from Kensington Palace for a day&rsquo;s
hunting, his horse stumbled&mdash;presumably in Hampton
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg&nbsp;30]</a></span>
Court Park&mdash;throwing the King so that he broke his
collar bone. William had for some time been suffering
in health, but when the broken bone was set he
insisted on returning to Kensington, and there he
died on 8 March, just over a fortnight later.</p>

<p>Queen Anne was at Hampton Court many times
during her reign of a dozen years, but the story of
that reign is not much associated with the Palace,
though that association is immortalized in a couplet
of Pope&rsquo;s <i>Rape of the Lock</i>, the scene of which comedy-narrative
is set here. Here the bold baron of the
poem cut one of the tempting locks from the fair
Belinda&rsquo;s head, and a family feud followed which was
only stopped by Pope&rsquo;s delightful poem.</p>

<p>With the coming of the Hanoverians the importance
of the Palace as a Court centre dwindled. It
is true that George the First and his son, while Prince
of Wales, were often at Hampton Court, and that
the latter when he became George the Second carried
out a number of minor alterations; but the place became
less regularly and less notably a centre of royal
pageantry, though it was more than once made the
centre of state theatrical performances. King George
the Third never took up his residence here at all, owing,
it is said, to the fact that it was here that his grandfather
had boxed his ears! It was, indeed, during
his long reign that the removal of many furnishings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg&nbsp;31]</a></span>
of the Palace, and the systematic allotting of suites
of rooms to people who had some claim on royal
gratitude took place. After the death of George the
Second Hampton Court ceased to be used as a royal
residence, and shortly after the accession of Queen
Victoria the State Apartments were thrown open to
the public, and the Palace gradually came to be
recognized as one of the most delightful and interesting
centres of historical association within easy
reach of the metropolis.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<h2>V</h2>


<p>It has been seen that Hampton Court Palace has
associations&mdash;often peculiar and intimate associations&mdash;with
our monarchs for close upon three hundred
years. In the first two chief courts, in the Great
Hall, the kitchens, the old cloisters, and the courts
along the north side of the building, it is not a difficult
effort of the imagination that is required to
make us see it as it was in the brightly-attired
days of Tudor splendour and lavishness; to make us
realize the arrival in one of the courts of some noble
company, when the great Cardinal was entertaining
and when King Henry was setting forth hunting; to
make us realize the hurrying of the cooks and their
minions in the corridors and cloisters about the great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg&nbsp;32]</a></span>
kitchens, the knots of idlers and retainers in the lesser
courts. In the later portions of the Palace, the Fountain
Court and the State Chambers, we may, &ldquo;with
the mind&rsquo;s eye&rdquo;, see something of the more formal
brightness of a later day, may see the beaux and
beauties of the early eighteenth century promenading
or &ldquo;taking tea&rdquo; with &ldquo;proud Anna whom three realms
obey&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The casual visitor to Hampton Court probably carries
away two or three definite impressions of the place, of
a medley of decorated chimneystacks, of warm red
brick, of cool quadrangles, of broad lawns and blazing
flower beds, of an outlook over a boat-dotted river, of
galleries filled with a bewildering succession of old
paintings, of tapestried walls&mdash;and of the whole set
amid stretching tree-grown levels. It is, however,
necessary to know the place closely to appreciate it
fully&mdash;it grows upon one, as the saying is; we should
have seen the homely court of the Master Carpenter
as well as the stately Fountain Court, the sculptures
in the gardens as well as the encyclop&aelig;dic clock, the
kitchens as well as the picture galleries, to have
lingered about the Wilderness in the spring as well
as to have seen the Broad Walk in the blaze of
summer, to have visited in some of the residences as
well as to have passed through the public galleries,
to have been about it at all seasons and not merely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg&nbsp;33]</a></span>
to have scampered through it as the central incident
in a half-day&rsquo;s excursion. It is, indeed, properly a
place for restful enjoyment rather than for hurried
sightseeing; though a hurried glimpse may well prove
a provocation to further visits and more leisurely inspection.</p>

<p class="caption">FOUNTAIN COURT</p>

<p>Perhaps in beginning a ramble about the Palace
and its grounds it may be assumed that most people
arrive by railway at the station which, though it is in
East Molesey at the Surrey end of the bridge, takes
its name from the palace on the Middlesex bank.
This means that they enter it&mdash;as also do those who
journey from London by tramcar&mdash;at the Trophy Gate,
and have before them at once, at the end of a broad
gravel walk, the Outer Court and the rich red-brick
medley of the Tudor buildings, to which the eye is
led by the severely plain row of low barracks on the
left, and a row of fine elms along the towing path on
the right. Here, at the west front, the recently-cleared
moat at once attracts attention. Until within the past
year or two the gravel forecourt extended right up
to the palace walls, but excavation revealed that the
course of the moat, and the very walls of the moat,
and the old bridge approach to the Gatehouse were
still plainly traceable. The rubbish with which long
since the moat had been filled&mdash;possibly when William
the Third made his alterations to the Palace, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg&nbsp;34]</a></span>
perhaps even earlier&mdash;was cleared away, the brick sides
revealed, the bottom of the moat neatly turfed over,
and a parapet with shield-bearing heraldical beasts
erected on either side. These heraldical beasts, it
must be admitted&mdash;whether a restoration in accordance
with an old design or not&mdash;tend to spoil the approach
to the Great Gatehouse, for the whole would
have gained in dignity had they been omitted and
the plain low castellated wall remained unadorned.
The similar banner-bearing heraldical beasts along
the roof of the Great Hall look far better on the skyline&mdash;but
their fellows on the eyeline below mar the
dignity of the approach considerably.</p>

<p>The beautiful red brickwork, the various castellated
turrets, and the clusters of decorated chimneys, with
the quaintly carven beasts seemingly toboganning
down the gables of the wings, together form a fine
example of Tudor architecture, though the appearance
would have been still better had the Gatehouse when
restored in the eighteenth century been kept to its
original proportions, and had the leaden cupolas not
been removed from the many turrets. Two or three
of those turrets that remain in other parts of the
buildings retain their cupolas, to indicate how fine
must have been the whole effect before any had been
removed. In the wall of either tower of the gateway
is to be seen a terra-cotta medallion portrait of one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg&nbsp;35]</a></span>
of the C&aelig;sars, others of which will be noticed in the
succeeding courts.</p>

<p>The wing to the right as we front the Gatehouse
is the south-west wing and is worthy of special mention
before entering the buildings, for there one of
Hampton Court&rsquo;s ghosts has been given to manifesting
itself. This is the ghost of Mistress Penn who was
nurse to Edward the Sixth. An elaborate and circumstantial
story tells of the sound being heard of a
ghostly spinning-wheel, and when search was made by
the officials a small sealed-up chamber was revealed,
containing nothing but a spinning-wheel and a chair!</p>

<p>Entering through the Great Gatehouse&mdash;where,
though the Palace is no longer used as a residence
by the royal family, a sentry is always on guard&mdash;we
reach the First Green Court or Base Court&mdash;a
peaceful quadrangle surrounded by low red buildings
with the western end of the Great Hall fronting us to
the left. This, the only turfed &ldquo;quad&rdquo;, is the largest
of them all. In the surrounding rooms are supposed
to have been many of the chambers which Wolsey
allotted to his guests when they came in such numbers
as are indicated in the passage already quoted
from Master George Cavendish. Opposite us is the
end of the Great Hall to the left, and directly in front
is the clock gatehouse on either turret of which is to
be observed one of those terra-cotta plaques of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg&nbsp;36]</a></span>
Roman Emperors which were at one time thought to
have been the work of Della Robbia, and to have been
presented to Wolsey when he was building, but which
Mr. Law has shown to be the work of Joannes Maiano
and to have been ordered by the Cardinal. This gate
is known as Anne Boleyn&rsquo;s Gateway, in the groined
ceiling (restored) of which as we pass beneath are to
be noticed around a central Tudor rose the monograms
of that unhappy Queen, Henry the Eighth, and
&ldquo;T.&nbsp;C.&rdquo; repeated alternately with them&mdash;the last-mentioned
initials may well puzzle the visitor who does
not know that they stand for Thomas Cardinal, a
designation which Wolsey was fond of employing.</p>

<p>A broad flight of steps to the left leads upwards
from Anne Boleyn&rsquo;s Gateway to the Great Hall, but
before proceeding thither most visitors will wish to
look into the Clock Court beyond. In this Court
we get the greatest clashing of the two periods
to which the Palace as we know it to-day belongs.
On the left, or north side, is the buttressed wall of
the Great Hall with above the pinnacles surmounted
by the heraldical beasts already referred to; while on
the right is a colonnade masking the Tudor buildings
on that side&mdash;Wolsey&rsquo;s own apartments&mdash;in most incongruous
fashion. Beneath that colonnade is the
entrance to the King&rsquo;s Grand Staircase and so to the
State Rooms now known as the Picture Galleries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg&nbsp;37]</a></span>
Looking back at the gateway through which we
have come we see the wonderful clock&mdash;a veritable
horological encyclop&aelig;dia&mdash;which, after lying long
neglected, was in the latter part of last century restored
to its original position and set going. It was
first put up in 1540 and is a remarkable survival from
that time&mdash;though everything but the dial has been
renewed&mdash;seeing that we can now ascertain from it,
according to Mr. Ernest Law&mdash;though but few visitors
are likely to seek to obtain all this information from it&mdash;&ldquo;the
hour, the month, the day of the month, the
position of the sun in the ecliptic, the number of
days since the beginning of the year, the phase of
the moon, its age in days, the hour of the day at
which it souths (that is crosses the meridian), and
thence the time of highwater at London Bridge&rdquo;. It
may be said that the clock needs a deal of learning,
and those who merely wish to know the time of day
can find it more expeditiously by consulting the conventional
dial that fronts on the Base Court.</p>

<p>Two interesting matters connected with the
astronomical clock are worthy of passing mention&mdash;one
is that its bell which strikes the hours is probably
the oldest thing about the Palace, for it goes
back to some years before Wolsey acquired the manor,
and is mentioned among the properties at the place
where he purchased it; and the other is that ever since
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg&nbsp;38]</a></span>
the clock struck the hour at which Anne of Denmark,
the Queen of James the First, passed away in
1619 it is said to have stopped whenever an old resident
of the Palace has died. Those curious in such
matters declare, according to the historian of the
Palace, that there have been many coincidences in
support of this superstition. Perhaps the custom
grew up of stopping the clock on the occasion of a
death. Beneath the dial is to be seen an elaborate
piece of relief sculpture in terra-cotta representing
the coat of arms of Wolsey supported by plump
cherubs and surmounted by the Cardinal&rsquo;s hat, the
monogram &ldquo;T.&nbsp;W.&rdquo;, and the date 1525&mdash;presumably
the date of the completion of this gateway.</p>

<p>On the farther side of the Clock Court is the entrance
to the Queen&rsquo;s Staircase, on passing through
the hall at the foot of which we come to the Chapel
and the Fountain Court. At the entrance are two
more of the terra-cotta plaques to which reference
has already been made.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">THE GREAT HALL</p>

<p>Turning back for a time to Anne Boleyn&rsquo;s Gateway
we may follow the steps up to the Great Hall,
and entering from beneath the Minstrels&rsquo; Gallery at
a doorway through an elaborately carven screen, we
see at once before us one of the finest and most
impressive of Tudor halls&mdash;very similar to but not
quite so large as that of Christ Church at Oxford.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg&nbsp;39]</a></span>
Whether we look up towards the dais as we enter
from under the Minstrels&rsquo; Gallery, or whether standing
on the dais&mdash;raised but a few inches from the general
level of the hall&mdash;we look back towards the Minstrels&rsquo;
Gallery and the blue west window above it&mdash;it is a
grand and pleasing view that we get. The tapestried
walls, the high windows, and the fine Perpendicular
hammer-beam roof together form a magnificent and
pleasing whole, one of the noblest halls of its period
that the country has to show. The tapestries, in
which are depicted incidents in the life of Abraham&mdash;though
time has dimmed somewhat the splendour
of their colouring&mdash;are yet remarkable links with Tudor
times, for they were purchased by Henry the Eighth
and have remained at Hampton Court ever since the
period of their acquisition. Though much restoration
was done in the middle of last century the general
character of the whole was not interfered with. Then
it was that the stained glass was put in&mdash;to replace
that which had presumably been destroyed during the
times &ldquo;when civil dudgeon first grew high and men
fell out they knew not why&rdquo;&mdash;and we may well be
grateful that the taste displayed in doing so was on
the whole so well displayed, though the garish blue
of the western window above the Minstrels&rsquo; Gallery
is perhaps an exception to that taste. The great oriel
window at the southern end of the dais, with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg&nbsp;40]</a></span>
beautiful groining above cannot fail to attract attention,
and looking back from the dais down the Hall
we may notice the elaboration and richness of the
magnificent roof, which is acknowledged to be probably
the most splendid roof of the kind ever erected
in England.</p>

<p>Though we see the Hall to-day with but a few
sightseers in it, it needs no great effort of imagination
to repeople it with figures of the past; to recall
the time when it was a centre of Tudor revellings,
or when King James sat in his chair by the great
oriel or Bay Window and saw the &ldquo;goddesses&rdquo; descend
from the &ldquo;heaven&rdquo; above the Minstrels&rsquo; Gallery
to carry on their masquings below. At the farther
end of the dais is a door, now covered over, leading
to the antechamber known as the Horn Room.</p>

<p>A doorway in the eastern end of the Hall from the
centre of the dais gives into the Great Watching
Chamber which runs at right angles to it. This also
is one of Henry the Eighth&rsquo;s contributions to the
Palace, and with its richly ornamented roof, its wonderfully
elaborate old tapestries may be regarded as
one of the most fascinating and interesting parts of
it. Indeed, if we except the Great Hall itself, this
is the most remarkable part of the Tudor edifice that
remains. According to an old engraving it was in
this chamber that Cardinal Wolsey entertained the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg&nbsp;41]</a></span>
French ambassadors at the sumptuous banquet referred
to earlier.</p>

<p>The tapestries here, representing the Triumphs of
Renown, Time, and Fate, are particularly interesting as
they form part of a series bought by Cardinal Wolsey
in 1523 and have been hanging at Hampton Court for
close upon four hundred years. They are old Flemish
work, and should be supplemented by three others if
the set were complete. These wonderful examples of
ancient &ldquo;art needlework&rdquo; are the more interesting
from the fact of their being links with the original
Palace. It should be remembered to Cromwell&rsquo;s credit
that, though they were duly valued as among the
available Crown assets, he refused to permit of their
removal, and thus we have in them one of the most
notable links with the gorgeous past of Hampton
Court. At the farther end of the Great Watching
Chamber is a small room&mdash;the Horn Room&mdash;with stairs
leading down to the cloisters and kitchens, and with
the closed doorway giving on to the northern end
of the dais in the Great Hall.</p>

<p>Before passing on into the Orange part of the
buildings, the State Rooms and Picture Galleries, we
may retrace our steps to the outer court, at the north
side of which, passing under an archway, we go
through the delightful series of courts along the north
side of the Palace&mdash;the Lord Chamberlain&rsquo;s Court,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg&nbsp;42]</a></span>
the Master Carpenter&rsquo;s Court, and others. Here are
to be seen the narrow, irregular side courts of the old
Tudor buildings, and remnants of the past in old lead
water pipes, and in the heraldical beasts along the
roof of the Great Hall which are most effectively seen
from the Master Carpenter&rsquo;s Court, through which we
gain access to the cloisters and the ancient kitchens.
The kitchens, which unfortunately are not thrown open
to the public, are much as they were in olden days,
and afford a curious and interesting glimpse of old-time
domestic conditions, with their great fireplaces
and their &ldquo;hatches&rdquo;, through which the dishes were
passed to the servers whose duty it was to take them
to the dining-hall.</p>

<p>Continuing past the kitchens the passage turns to
the right and comes out at the north-west angle of the
Fountain Court, before reaching which point, however,
the entrance to the Chapel is passed on the left. On
either side of the Chapel door are to be seen, carved,
coloured, and gilt, the arms of Henry the Eighth and
Seymour with the initials of the King and the Queen
(of the moment) united by a true lover&rsquo;s knot. The
true lover&rsquo;s knot was but a slip knot to the fickle
king, the Queen Jane&rsquo;s arms and cipher but replaced
the earlier ones of Anne&rsquo;s.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">THE POND GARDEN</p>

<p>The present chapel was one of King Henry&rsquo;s additions&mdash;Wolsey&rsquo;s
original chapel being either entirely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg&nbsp;43]</a></span>
demolished or so altered as to be made anew. It
has been surmised that had the great Churchman&rsquo;s
edifice remained it would have been something externally
beautiful and notable, whereas the present
building is so much hidden that I have more than
once known visitors to point out the Great Hall as
being the Chapel. If the King did not make much
of the Chapel externally, he lavished attention on it
internally, so that a German visitor toward the close
of the sixteenth century was able to wax enthusiastic
as to its splendour. Above the public entrance near
the Fountain Court is the great Royal Pew&mdash;entered
from the Haunted Gallery&mdash;with a painted ceiling.</p>

<p>Though the Chapel dates from Tudor times, it must
be remembered that its interior was rearranged and
redecorated in the reign of Queen Anne, and that those
responsible for the work were by no means hampered
by any pedantic ideas of congruity. A matter of
grievance to many visitors is that the Chapel is not
thrown open to the public. It can only be seen at
service time.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<h2>VI</h2>


<p>Entirely different is the impression which we take
away with us of the Orange portion of Hampton Court
Palace from that which remains in memory of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg&nbsp;44]</a></span>
Tudor parts. From the west and north we see nothing
but the medley of red brickwork, gables, turrets, and
irregular chimneystacks. From the east and south
sides we get views that contrast greatly with those
of the older portions. Here we have long straight
fronts broken with many stone-framed windows, and
surmounted by a regular stone parapet that quite inadequately
masks the more modern chimneystacks.
These south and west fronts are sometimes criticized
by those who regret the parts of the Tudor palace
demolished to make room for them, but they are by
no means wanting in either dignity or beauty. Their
red brick&mdash;less rich in tone than that of the Tudor
buildings&mdash;is much broken with white stone ornamentation,
and the southern side as seen from the gardens
through massed shrubs is particularly fine. This part
of the palace probably remains in the memory of most
visitors as being Hampton Court, and it is only natural
that it should be so, for it is the portion mainly seen
from the grounds, and it is the portion with which
visitors make the most intimate acquaintance&mdash;for
within it, on the first floor, are the many State Rooms
in which are hung the magnificent collection of pictures.</p>

<p>To reach the State Rooms, as has been said, we
enter the Clock Court and catering across it to the
right pass under the colonnade which uglifies the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg&nbsp;45]</a></span>
front of Wolsey&rsquo;s rooms, and so come to the King&rsquo;s
Great Staircase by which the public reaches the
galleries. This staircase, its walls and ceiling painted
by Verrio, has on the whole a somewhat sombre and
certainly unpleasing effect. It is true that we have
in it one of the most notable examples of Verrio&rsquo;s
decorative achievements, but it is an example which
I frankly find unattractive. It is sombrely gorgeous
but in an unrestful fashion, with its sprawling gods,
goddesses, and heroes in all manner of impossible
positions, its pillars overhung with clouds or clouds
swooping down, as though weighted with the figures,
about the pillars. Beneath in a brownish tone are
painted various &ldquo;trophies&rdquo;. The art of decoration,
one cannot help feeling, was at the time that William
the Third had this staircase painted, at a very low
ebb indeed.</p>

<p>Curiosity may make some visitors pause to single
out from the medley the figures of the Fates, the
C&aelig;sars, or particular gods and goddesses, but most
will pass on into the noble King&rsquo;s Guard Room with
its wonderful mural decoration of muskets, pikes, and
pistols. Though there are some pictures here&mdash;notably,
opposite the fireplace, a large portrait by Zucchero of
Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s porter&mdash;it is chiefly the old arms
marvellously arrayed in diverse patterns that take the
eye. Upwards of a thousand pieces are said to have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg&nbsp;46]</a></span>
been utilized in decorating this room&mdash;their arrangement
being made by a gunsmith who had earlier done
similar work at Windsor Castle and the Tower of
London. It may be added that he utilized his materials
more successfully than did Verrio in painting the staircase,
and it is pleasant to learn that Gunsmith Harris&rsquo;s
work was so well appreciated that he was granted a
pension by way of reward. From the tall windows
at the farther end of the Guard Room we look out
over the Privy Garden to the river, with the terraced
Queen Mary&rsquo;s Bower on the right.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to describe in detail the things
to be seen in the long succession of State Rooms, from
the entrance to them by the King&rsquo;s Great Staircase
to the exit by the Queen&rsquo;s Great Staircase. Varying
in size in accordance to the purpose for which they
were designed, audience rooms, bedrooms, writing
closets, or galleries, all are lofty rooms, and some of
the smallest are the most crowded with pictures&mdash;as,
for example, the Queen Mary&rsquo;s closet&mdash;leaving
which we pass from the rooms that occupy the first
floor of the south front to those of the rather longer
east front. Details as to the paintings, tapestries,
or furnishings would alone occupy more than the
space of this little book, and the visitor in search
of such details will find them in the official handbooks.
The tall windows, rising from the window seat level,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg&nbsp;47]</a></span>
and affording beautiful views of the grounds, form a
feature of the Orange portion of the buildings, which
shows a distinct advance upon the earlier style of
fenestration&mdash;picturesque as are the smaller type of
windows of the Tudor period.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">EAST FRONT FROM THE LONG WATER</p>

<p>The southern range of rooms formed the King&rsquo;s
suite, and passing from the Guard Room, we go successively
through: the First Presence Chamber, in
which are to be seen Sir Godfrey Kneller&rsquo;s &ldquo;Beauties&rdquo;
of the Orange Court; the Second Presence Chamber,
the most memorable thing in which is Van Dyck&rsquo;s fine
equestrian portrait of Charles the First; the Audience
Chamber with a portrait of Elizabeth, Queen of Bohemia,
over the fireplace; the King&rsquo;s Drawing Room;
King William&rsquo;s Bedroom, with an ornate ceiling
painted by Sir William Thornhill, and the great
canopied bed with time-worn crimson silk hangings;
the King&rsquo;s Dressing Room, in which are several Holbeins
including two portraits of Henry the Eighth; and
the last of King William&rsquo;s rooms, the Writing Closet,
in which are to be seen Zucchero&rsquo;s portrait of Queen
Elizabeth in fancy dress, also a smaller one of her,
and a remarkable full length of Henry Howard, Earl
of Surrey, in scarlet costume.</p>

<p>Turning at an angle through Queen Mary&rsquo;s closet
we pass on to inspect the series of rooms which Her
Majesty did not live to occupy, and from the generous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg&nbsp;48]</a></span>
windows we get beautiful views of the yew-grown
lawns and the park beyond&mdash;the view straight up the
Long Canal from the Queen&rsquo;s Drawing Room is particularly
fine, especially when the broad gravel walks
between the avenued yews are dotted with summer
visitors, and the beds are gorgeous with many flowers
set in the wide greenery of the lawn. Before reaching
the Drawing Room we come to the Queen&rsquo;s Gallery,
hung with rich tapestry and ornamented with splendid
china vases, and the Queen&rsquo;s Bed Room, the bed hung
with remarkably fresh-looking ornate hangings in red
and gold. Beyond the Drawing Room are the Queen&rsquo;s
Audience Chamber, the Public Drawing Room, and at
the end of the eastern front the Prince of Wales&rsquo; suite.</p>

<p>Through the farther end of the Drawing Room
is the Queen&rsquo;s Presence Chamber, with another magnificent
canopied bed, and beyond it, the Queen&rsquo;s
Guard Room, giving on to the stairs. These last two
rooms look out on to the Fountain Court, of which
they form the northern side, but they do not exhaust
the rooms open to public inspection; for along the
eastern side of the Court is a series of smaller rooms,
containing further pictures and furnishings. Owing
to the smallness of these rooms, their darkness, and
the fact that visitors can only pass straight through
them from door to door, close inspection of the pictures
is not easy. Along the whole length of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg&nbsp;49]</a></span>
southern side of the Fountain Court is the King&rsquo;s
Gallery or Great Council Chamber&mdash;a magnificent room
in which used to hang the Raphael Cartoons now at
South Kensington. The room was, indeed, designed
by Sir Christopher Wren as a setting for those
famous pictures; and the walls are now covered by
reproductions of them in tapestry. On the west side
of the Court is the Communication Gallery leading to
the Queen&rsquo;s Great Staircase, and it is worthy of note
that from the last of the State Rooms the visitor
should carry away impressions of one of the most
splendid of Hampton Court&rsquo;s many splendid art treasures.
Along the wall here are the nine large tempera
pictures by Mantegna&mdash;&ldquo;one of the chief heroes in
the advance of painting in Italy&rdquo;&mdash;in which are represented
&ldquo;The Triumph of C&aelig;sar&rdquo;. Says Mr. William
Michael Rossetti, &ldquo;these superbly invented and designed
compositions, gorgeous with all splendour of
subject-matter and accessory, and with the classical
learning and enthusiasm of one of the master spirits
of the age, have always been accounted of the first
rank among Mantegna&rsquo;s works&rdquo;. Though in part
restored, these paintings, by an artist who died more
than four hundred years ago, are full of interest for
their vivid presentation of a rich imagination of a
great historical event. In front of the victor&mdash;in the
last of this series of paintings&mdash;is borne a device
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg&nbsp;50]</a></span>
bearing his famous words &ldquo;Veni, Vidi, Vici&rdquo;&mdash;and it
is worthy of recollection that one tradition places the
scene of Julius C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s final victory over the Britons
at Kingston, not far from where this splendid delineation
of his triumphal pageant on his return to Rome
has hung for close upon three centuries. Though
it is a fine final memory to bring away from the
rooms, it is perhaps to be regretted that this series
of paintings is in the last of the galleries through
which we pass; for, as I have learned from various
visitors&mdash;after going through more than a couple of
dozen rooms and galleries, housing about a thousand
pictures, and tapestries besides other articles of interest&mdash;the
eye has become wearied and the mind
overcharged with an embarrassment of riches. Several
people have told me that they have come through
these last galleries scarce noticing what was on the
walls at all. It is a pity that the rule of having to
pass through the rooms always in one order cannot
be maintained only on Sundays, holidays, and such
days as there are crowds, when such order is necessary
for the comfort of all; at other times, when there are
but few people about, it might surely be permissible
to enter or leave the State Rooms by either of the
great staircases.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">THE WILDERNESS IN SPRING</p>

<p>Of the riches of art in the Palace this is not the
place to speak in detail, it is only possible to hint
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg&nbsp;51]</a></span>
at them. Before leaving the Communication Gallery
for the exit staircase there are small rooms to the
left which call for inspection&mdash;rooms which not only
mark internally the linking of the original Tudor
Palace with the Orange additions, but which also are
traditionally associated with the builder of the Palace
himself, for here is Wolsey&rsquo;s Closet. In the outer
lobby the most interesting object is the drawing (after
Wynegaarde) of Hampton Court Palace as seen from
the Thames in 1558. From this may be noted the
extent of building demolished, or masked, when Wren
carried out his work of rebuilding for William the
Third. The Closet is chiefly notable for its beautiful
ceiling, its mullioned window, and its fine linen-fold
panelling which, however, though of old workmanship,
has been brought together here from various parts of
the Palace. The room is supposed, from the frieze,
to have been at one time much larger than it now
is. In the corner, between fireplace and window, is
a small room, sometimes described as an oratory.
Though other of Wolsey&rsquo;s rooms remain, they are
part of the private apartments of the Palace, and not,
of course, accessible to visitors, and this small Closet
and its lobbies is, therefore, worth lingering over.</p>

<p>During the latter part of a promenade through the
State Rooms, as has been pointed out, we go practically
round the four sides of the Fountain Court,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg&nbsp;52]</a></span>
and when descending the stairs and leaving the hall
below them, we find ourselves in the north-western
corner of the Cloisters that surround the Court. Entirely
differing from the Tudor ones, this is the most
impressive of all the courts here, with its cloisters
surrounding a quadrangle of greenery in the midst
of which a fountain plays. Whether looked at from
the gallery windows, where the plashing of the water
may be heard on a summer day, or examined in our
walk round the Cloisters, the Fountain Court is a beautiful
and restful place, which, with its surrounding of
untrodden grass&mdash;starred in spring with myriad daisies&mdash;forms
a delightful contrast to the white cloister
pillars and the red brick walls above. Over the windows
of the King&rsquo;s Gallery on the south side are a
dozen round, false windows, filled with time and atmosphere
darkened paintings. These paintings, now but
dimly discernible as such, were the work of Louis
Laguerre, who had been employed in &ldquo;restoring&rdquo; the
Mantegna &ldquo;Triumph&rdquo; in the Communication Gallery,
who was very highly esteemed as an artist by William
the Third, and who was granted by that monarch apartments
in Hampton Court. Probably these pictures, representing
the Twelve Labours of Hercules, are beyond
fresh restoration, otherwise they might presumably be
cleaned and glazed to save them from disappearing
completely. Laguerre is said also to be responsible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg&nbsp;53]</a></span>
for the painting of imitation windows in similar circular
spaces on the south front of the Palace&mdash;imitations
which are frankly hideous. The spaces would
look far better if filled with plain brick or stone.
Perhaps some of these spaces being occupied with
practical windows, it was thought necessary for the
sake of symmetry to make the rest appear such to
the casual glance. Around the Fountain Court&mdash;along
the north cloister of which the public way passes to
the gardens&mdash;are entrances to various apartments
allotted to private residents. On the east side flights
of steps go up to the two private suites, known as
the Gold Staff Gallery, at the south-eastern corner
of the Palace above the State Rooms. One of these
suites&mdash;at the south-east angle&mdash;is interesting as being
the one in which, according to tradition, took place
that &ldquo;Rape of the Lock&rdquo;, which Pope was to celebrate
in the most remarkable poem of its kind in the language.
Hither came the fair Belinda&mdash;Arabella Fermor&mdash;to
play that game of ombre which the poet was to
make famous; and here, her triumph at cards achieved,
she was taking coffee&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

<p>The Gold Staff Gallery has tragedy as well as
comedy in its history, for at one time the other suite
formed out of it&mdash;that facing south&mdash;was occupied by
Richard Tickell, grandson of that Thomas Tickell,
who, though a poet of some note in his day, is
chiefly remembered from his association with Addison.
Richard Tickell, who was also a poet and political
writer, married as his first wife the beautiful Mary
Linley, sister-in-law of Sheridan. On 4 November,
1793, Tickell&mdash;who appears to have been financially
embarrassed&mdash;threw himself from the window of one of
his rooms here, and was killed instantly on the gravel
path below. Though it was officially decided at the
time&mdash;thanks, it is believed, to the influence of Sheridan&mdash;that
it was an accidental death, the historians
have no hesitation in describing the tragedy as suicide.</p>

<h2>VII</h2>


<p>Fascinating as are the old courts and the galleries
with their magnificent art collections, the grounds
which surround the Palace are, in their way, no less
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg&nbsp;55]</a></span>
enticing. Indeed, if we might judge by the thronging
crowds in flower time, the gardens form for the
majority of visitors the most attractive part of the
place. These gardens, wonderfully varied and beautifully
kept, are not by any means extensive for so
noble a Palace, but they prove an unfailing delight.
They are markedly divisible in character into three
portions&mdash;the north where is the Wilderness and Maze;
the south where are the Privy and Pond Gardens, the
Great Vine House and Queen Mary&rsquo;s Bower; and the
east&mdash;or Great Fountain Garden&mdash;with its rich herbaceous
border along the Broad Walk, its level lawns
set with great jewels of floral colour, its compact
yews, its radiating walks, its water-lily pond, and beyond
the gleaming stretch of the Long Canal and the
tall trees that border the Park. In all parts of these
gardens are to be seen beauties that delight the eye
and linger in the memory, and each of them successively
draws the sightseers.</p>

<p>These gardens have seen many changes during the
centuries of the Palace&rsquo;s history, changes largely from
one kind of formality to another, judging from the plans
of them at various times. As I have said that the
majority of visitors enter the Palace precincts by way
of the Western Trophy Gate, and as such visitors
would naturally reach the grounds by the eastern
entrance beyond the cloistered Fountain Court, it may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg&nbsp;56]</a></span>
be well to say something first of the eastern gardens&mdash;which
certainly, in summer, form the most florally
gorgeous part of the whole. We come out here in the
middle of the Broad Walk, which stretches from near
the Kingston Road to the Thames&rsquo; side. In front of us,
bordered by old yew trees, are gravel walks radiating
to the House or Home Park, the centre one leading,
round a fountain pond starred in summer with lovely
water lilies of various colours, to the head of the Long
Canal, where are many water fowl&mdash;swans, geese, and
ducks of different species&mdash;expectant of the visitors&rsquo;
contributions of bread or biscuit.</p>

<p>Right and left as we emerge from the Palace the
Broad Walk stretches, inviting us in each direction
with a brilliant display of many coloured flowers&mdash;more
especially in spring and early summer, when
the gardens, attractive at all times, are perhaps at
their very best. Old plans of the grounds of Hampton
Court show that these eastern gardens have seen the
greatest changes during successive centuries. At one
time the Long Canal stretched much closer to the
Palace, and after it was shortened the intervening
gardens were for a period a veritable maze of intricate
ornamental beds with small fountains dotted about
them; at another time they showed an array of formally
cut pyramidal evergreens disposed along the
sides of the walks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg&nbsp;57]</a></span>
It was probably the coming of William and Mary
to Hampton Court that caused special attention to
be paid to the grounds, for Queen Mary appears to
have been greatly interested in the matter. Many
and various as have been the re-plannings it may be
believed that never have the gardens looked better
than at present, when taste in things floricultural has
broken away from the formalism of scroll-pattern
borders and indulgence in the eccentricities of topiarian
art&mdash;is even, it is to be hoped, on the way to free
itself finally from the ugliness of &ldquo;carpet bedding&rdquo;&mdash;when
plants are largely grouped and massed instead of
being placed in alternate kinds at regular intervals in
geometrical patterns. Present day taste with its appreciation
of garden colour, of masses and groups of
particular kinds, instead of isolated plants dotted about
with irritating regularity, is found beautifully exemplified
in the numerous beds cut in the lawns of the
eastern gardens, and in the long borders which run
north and south of the palace along one side of the
Broad Walk. Here, from the beginning of the year,
when the patches of cerulean, &ldquo;glory of the snow&rdquo;,
and of low-growing irises of a deeper blue, begin
that procession which is soon to develop into a very
pageantry of colour&mdash;from when myriad yellow crocuses
first star the lawns with gold in February&mdash;is
given a succession of changes that may well tempt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg&nbsp;58]</a></span>
the lover of gardens to Hampton Court again and
again. These beds and borders with their succession
of spring bulbs and summer flowers, their brilliant
annuals and massed perennials are not only a delight
to the eyes of all, but that they afford endless hints,
are as it were horticulturally educational to garden-loving
visitors, may be gathered from the frequency
with which such visitors are seen to consult the name-labels
of the various plants.</p>

<p>The southern end of the Broad Walk is semi-circular
with an outlook over the river, upwards, to
where Molesey Lock and Weir are cut from view
by the hideous Hampton Court Bridge, and downwards,
towards Thames Ditton and Kingston. It is
one of the most charming views on the river near
London, the many trees on islands and banks shutting
off the neighbouring town. On a hot summer
day, the decorated houseboats moored to the Surrey
bank and the innumerable small craft passing up and
down help to form a delightful and characteristic bit
of the Stream of Pleasure. That the view is one that
is well appreciated is shown by the fact that on such
an afternoon the Water Gallery, as this view point
is named, generally attracts and holds many of the
visitors to the Palace.</p>

<p class="caption">THE LONG WATER IN WINTER</p>

<p>The name of the Water Gallery survives from that
of the building which at one time stood here, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg&nbsp;59]</a></span>
&ldquo;d&eacute;pendance&rdquo; which Queen Mary occupied while the
Palace was being rebuilt, and which was demolished
when the alterations were completed. East from this
point runs the Long Walk, parallel with, but well
above, the towing path, and affording a good view
along the river on one hand and glimpses of the park
on the other. This walk led to the old Bowling Green
and Pavilions. Some distance along it a gate gives
on to the towing path leading to Kingston Bridge.</p>

<p>South of the Palace&mdash;shut off from the eastern
gardens by a climber-covered wall&mdash;is the smaller but
very beautiful Privy Garden, with its turf-banked terraces
on either side, its sunken centre filled with
a wonderful variety of shrubs and trees. From the
terrace walk on the left we may look over the wall to
the eastern gardens and park; along the right-hand
terrace is formed Queen Mary&rsquo;s Bower, an intertwisted
avenue of trimmed and cut wych-elms, some
of the distorted trunks of which might have inspired
more than one of Dor&eacute;&rsquo;s Dante illustrations.
This shady bower is in summer particularly delightful,
and from the farther end of it is to be had, through
and above the evergreens of this Privy Garden, a
beautiful view of the south front of the Palace. At
the farther end of the Privy Garden, fencing it from
the towing path, are some magnificent iron gates and
screens.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg&nbsp;60]</a></span>
Along the gravel walk, immediately against the
south front of the Palace, are ranged in summer great
tubs with orange trees, believed to be those originally
planted here by Queen Mary&mdash;though it is not easy
to realize that they are over three hundred years old!
And close to this wall of the Palace stand two heroic
Statues, Hercules with his club, and another; it might
be thought, half of the quartette of figures that, as old
views of the Palace show, at one time stood on the
low columns which rise above the balustrading of the
roof, only that quartette is said to have consisted of
goddesses, since removed to Windsor. In an old
engraving, dated 1815, two figures are still to be seen
on the skyline.</p>

<p>Beyond the steps up to Queen Mary&rsquo;s Bower, a
gateway leads us to the farther Privy Gardens. On
the right may be observed where Wren&rsquo;s additions
end abruptly against the windows of Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s
Chambers, and her monogram is to be seen
carved boldly above the first-floor window in a decorative
ribbon pattern, while above the second-floor window
are her initials beside a crowned Tudor rose, each
carving having the date 1568.</p>

<p>Here we are in the Pond Garden&mdash;or series of gardens&mdash;on
the right, over a low old wall, is a small turfed
and flower grown enclosure with the long Orangery
at the farther side. On the left is a close grown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg&nbsp;61]</a></span>
hedge, beyond which are a succession of small garden
enclosures, only the centre one of which is kept up as
a show place, and this is the delightful quadrangular
enclosed space sometimes spoken of as the Dutch
Garden. This sunk garden, with its turf, its stone
walks, that are not walked upon, its small evergreens,
cut by topiarian art into the semblance of birds, its
low-growing plants rich in varicoloured flowers, its
evergreen arbour at the farther end as a background
to a statue of Venus, its little fountain in the centre,
is a spot that always attracts visitors&mdash;attracts and
holds them by its spell of quiet beauty.</p>

<p>At the farther end of the gravel walk is the glasshouse
in which for close upon a hundred and fifty
years has flourished the great grape vine, which
always proves an enormous attraction to those who
come to see the Palace. The vine&mdash;a Black Hamburg&mdash;was
planted in 1768, and it annually bears about
twelve hundred bunches of grapes, many incipient
bunches being removed in accordance with the custom
of viticulture to allow the rest to mature the
better. The vine has been known to bear well over
two thousand pounds weight&mdash;or about a ton&mdash;of
grapes in a single season. It is not, however, though
sometimes so described, the largest grape vine in
England.</p>

<p>To the north of the Palace&mdash;reached by a gate in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg&nbsp;62]</a></span>
the wall of the Long Walk, or first seen by those who
come to Hampton Court Palace through the Lion
Gate&mdash;is the Wilderness, a half-cultivated place contrasting
greatly with the parts of the grounds that we
have already been visiting. Here are tall trees of
various kinds, massed shrubs, and broad stretches of
turf spangled with daffodils and other bulbs in the
spring; within it is a smaller wilderness overlooked
by many visitors forming a kind of wild garden, its
many flowers growing upon the rocky banked sides
of the tortuous paths, with groups of slender bamboo,
flowering shrubs and brambles,&mdash;a place which
is particularly fascinating in the late springtime.</p>

<p>Here, too, close to the Lion Gate, is that Maze
which is always a popular feature with holiday-makers
old and young. Between the Wilderness and the
Palace lies the Old Melon Ground, now apparently
utilized by the gardeners whose incessant work maintains
the grounds of Hampton Court in so beautiful
a state. West of the Wilderness is the Old Tilt Yard,
long since given over from joustings and tiltings to
the cultivation of plants, and not open to the public.</p>

<p>To go back to the eastern garden, we see at its
farther edge the lime avenue, with beyond it the Home
Park, the two separated by shady canals well grown
with gorgeous water lilies and bordered by clumps of
fine foliage plants. It was presumably in the Park
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg&nbsp;63]</a></span>
near here that George Cavendish found Henry the
Eighth engaged at archery practice when he came
to tell him of the death of Wolsey. It was in this
Park, at the farther end near Kingston Bridge, that
Fox saw Oliver Cromwell just before his fatal seizure,
and it was in this Park, it is believed, that the tripping
of his horse over a molehill caused William the Third&rsquo;s
fatal fall. Just across the road bordering the northern
boundary of the Palace grounds lies the great extent
of Bushy Park, with its magnificent chestnut avenue;
and mention may be made of the fact that had King
William lived, and Wren&rsquo;s plans been fully carried
out, that avenue would have been the approach to
the grand new Palace front which it was designed to
make. As it is we have but such part of the Tudor
palace as the rebuilders allowed to remain, and we
have but such part of the Orange palace as destiny
allowed William to complete.</p>

<p>What we have, however, is a splendid whole, consisting,
it may be, of incongruous parts, yet one that
for charm, for beauty generally and in detail, and for
fullness of interest, has but few rivals. Whether we
visit it on some quiet day in winter, or in the
time when the grounds are at their floral best, and
when there are many hundreds of people thronging
the galleries and gardens on Sunday afternoons or
on popular holidays, it always gives us the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg&nbsp;64]</a></span>
feeling of satisfaction that comes of beautiful surroundings.
In the smaller courts and in the shady
cloisters may be found in the heat of summer the
soothing sense that is one of the secret charms of
haunts of ancient peace.</p>

<p>Cardinal Wolsey built himself a lordly pleasure
house, unthinking of the fickleness of a monarch&rsquo;s
favour; Dutch William sought to make of it a rival
to Versailles; and each, though he did not completely
realize his design, may be said to have builded better
than he knew&mdash;in providing for succeeding ages a
place of beauty &ldquo;in which the millions rejoice&rdquo;.</p>
